I've had this domain _forever_ and keep meaning to do something with it. In the meantime
it has a neko cat on there that animates now and then, and goes to sleep if the mouse doesn't
move for a period of time.

The background colours are created from overlapping <div> elements, with the colour selected
from the image used in the latest [Guardian](http://gu.com) story. Because it's all javascript
it used the [Guardian Image to Data](https://github.com/revdancatt/CAT510-guardian-image-to-data)
service to load in the remote image and treat it as data on an canvas element.
